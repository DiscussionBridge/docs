# Known Issues

This page records confirmed issues that operators may encounter while using or
building DiscussionBridge sites. It distinguishes product defects from
upstream framework behavior and keeps workarounds bounded.

## Astro

### Starlight

#### 1. Build Logs `Entry docs -> 404 was not found`

**Status:** Confirmed upstream Starlight behavior; GitHub issue prepared but not
yet filed.

**Impact:** Low. The message adds noise to otherwise successful builds. The
generated site and fallback 404 page continue to work.

**Observed message:**

```text
Entry docs -> 404 was not found.
```

**Confirmed reproduction:**

- the independent stock Starlight control repository at
  `DiscussionBridge/stockstarlight-demo-discussionbridge-dev`
- Astro `^7.0.4`
- Starlight `^0.41.2`
- no DiscussionBridge integration or component wiring required
- `npm run build` completes successfully and then prints the message

**Likely source:**

Starlight's generated 404 route checks for an optional user-authored `404`
entry with `getEntry("docs", "404")`. When `src/content/docs/404.md` does not
exist, Astro reports the missing entry even though Starlight correctly falls
back to its generated 404 page.

**Controls already tested:**

- `disable404Route: true` removes the message, confirming that the injected
  Starlight 404 route is involved.
- Adding `src/content/docs/404.md` removes the missing-entry message but causes
  a route-conflict warning because the docs catch-all also tries to render
  `/404`. This is not a clean workaround.

**Current operator guidance:**

- If the build succeeds and the generated 404 page works, treat the message as
  a known warning.
- Do not add `src/content/docs/404.md` solely to silence it.
- Use `disable404Route: true` only when the site deliberately supplies and
  verifies another 404 implementation.

**Possible upstream fix:**

Starlight could probe for the optional custom 404 entry without emitting a
missing-entry diagnostic for the expected absence, or otherwise suppress that
expected miss inside its generated 404 route. The fallback behavior should
remain unchanged.

**Prepared GitHub issue:**

Title:

```text
Generated 404 route logs "Entry docs -> 404 was not found" when no custom 404 entry exists
```

Body:

```markdown
### What happened?

A clean Starlight build succeeds but prints:

`Entry docs -> 404 was not found.`

The site has no `src/content/docs/404.md`, so Starlight should use its generated
fallback 404 page. The fallback works; the unexpected part is the missing-entry
diagnostic during an otherwise successful build.

### Reproduction

1. Create a stock Starlight site using Astro `^7.0.4` and Starlight `^0.41.2`.
2. Do not create `src/content/docs/404.md`.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. Observe that the build succeeds and then logs
   `Entry docs -> 404 was not found.`

A minimal control is available in
`DiscussionBridge/stockstarlight-demo-discussionbridge-dev`.

### Additional findings

- `disable404Route: true` removes the message.
- Adding `src/content/docs/404.md` removes the missing-entry message but creates
  a route conflict because the docs catch-all also attempts to render `/404`.
- The likely source is the generated Starlight 404 route probing the optional
  docs entry with `getEntry("docs", "404")`.

### Expected behavior

The generated fallback 404 route should continue to work without logging a
missing-entry diagnostic when the optional custom `404` docs entry is absent.

### Possible direction

Probe for the optional entry without emitting a diagnostic for the expected
absence, or suppress that expected miss inside the generated 404 route.

Before filing, reproduce once against the current Starlight release and replace
the version ranges above with the exact installed versions.

## Discourse

### Granular API Keys Cannot Read Every Diagnostics Endpoint

**Status:** Confirmed in DiscussionBridge field testing. The upstream question
about a supported granular scope for these site-level reads remains open.
DiscussionBridge provides a bounded fallback.

**Impact:** A least-privilege granular publishing key can perform normal
publishing work but may receive `403 Forbidden` from site-level endpoints used
by `check-discourse`. One granular key therefore cannot currently provide every
publishing and setup-diagnostics capability that DiscussionBridge needs.

With the exercised granular key configuration, the publishing key could read
`/categories.json` and `/tags.json`, but could not read all of:

- `/site/settings.json`
- `/site.json`
- `/embed/info`
- exact page-URL reconciliation search

This affects automatic discovery of authoring limits, user-specific tag
capabilities, and some existing-topic reconciliation checks. It does not mean
routine publishing must use a global key.

**Current operator guidance:**

- Use a granular publishing key for `publish-new`, `sync-existing`, and
  `publish-and-sync`.
- Use a separate global/admin-capable diagnostics key only for
  `check-discourse` setup checks that require the unavailable reads.
- Keep the diagnostics key out of ordinary publishing builds and CI unless its
  use is explicit and protected.
- When a broader diagnostics key is unavailable, configure known authoring
  limits explicitly and treat unavailable capability checks as unresolved.

The desired future state is a granular diagnostics/read key that can access the
required metadata and reconciliation endpoints. Until Discourse exposes or
confirms those scopes, the documented publishing-key plus diagnostics-key
model remains the least-privilege operational fallback.

Background and upstream clarification:
[Confirming API access to authoring-limit site settings](https://meta.discourse.org/t/confirming-api-access-to-authoring-limit-site-settings/407937).
The thread confirms the public/client endpoint pattern; its granular-scope
follow-up has not yet received an upstream answer.
