## Strategy Discovered Through Building

DiscussionBridge started with a practical need: Astro pages should have real Discourse discussions. Building the bridge revealed the larger system around that need:

- publishing lanes
- source-of-truth rules
- diagnostics and setup checks
- key models and permission boundaries
- operational docs as product memory
- future Discourse plugin control-plane possibilities
- central organization, chapter, regional, public, private, and internal community use cases
- static publishing clarity plus community continuity
- content lanes and explicit source ownership
- diagnostic/runtime key boundaries
- bidirectional but single-writer flows
- purposeful connections where every connection has a job
- local/national federation
- optional Discourse-side enhancement without making Tier 1 plugin-dependent

This is a WebSynergetics-style process: start with useful work, let the work expose the system, then capture the reusable pattern where it belongs.

This product definition was discovered through implementation. It is not a
retrofitted feature list: an initially undefined static-site/community
connection problem exposed the operating model one real constraint at a time.

## Discourse-Centered, Adapter-Driven Architecture

DiscussionBridge is a Discourse-centered, adapter-driven content and
discussion orchestration system. Its portable core connects Discourse with one
or more external publishing systems while preserving authority, provenance,
policy, and auditability.

Discourse is the present operational home and control plane. The Discussion
Bridge for Discourse plugin should host and operate the portable core and be the
primary operating surface for almost all Bridge orchestration and policy. This
is a deliberate use of Discourse's users, permissions, jobs, UI, database,
APIs, and operational machinery—not an accidental coupling of the domain model
to one host.

The portable core owns:

- connections and external-system identities;
- source/destination mappings and direction;
- policies, jobs, comparisons, and approvals;
- target-specific retry and recovery state;
- provenance and durable audit evidence.

Astro, Statamic, and future integrations are well-featured adapters. They
translate the portable contract into each publishing system's content,
navigation, rendering, build, and deployment model; they are not separate
control planes. One Discourse installation may operate connections to multiple
publishing systems concurrently.

Tier 1 API-only operation remains a useful compatibility and self-serve
capability, but it is no longer the product's natural operational center.
Current Astro implementation remains valuable prototype and field evidence.
Each behavior should now be classified as portable-core domain logic,
Discourse-host behavior, or Astro-adapter behavior before it is extended.

Portability remains a design constraint. Core domain logic should not depend on
Discourse internals when a stable host-neutral contract is practical. This
preserves a later standalone hosting path without requiring the product to be
reinvented. The human outcome is autonomy: authorized people can operate,
understand, govern, and move their system without being trapped by a CMS
adapter or accidental implementation boundary.

This architecture was discovered through the work—the WebSynergetics way. It
is a settled product direction, while migration of existing Astro behavior into
the core/plugin/adapter boundaries remains implementation work and must not be
described as complete.

The intact source decision is preserved in
`docs/evidence/DISCUSSION_BRIDGE_DISCOURSE_CENTERED_DOCTRINE_2026-07-25.md`.
The authoritative system boundaries and migration sequence are maintained in
`docs/CORE_ADAPTER_ARCHITECTURE.md` and
`docs/CORE_ADAPTER_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`.

## One DiscussionBridge Product Family

Everything stays under the DiscussionBridge tent. DiscussionBridge for
Discourse is the free, fully featured plugin and local operational center.
DiscussionBridge for Astro is the free, fully featured Astro adapter.
DiscussionBridge SaaS is the paid, managed standalone control plane for
multiple CMSs, sites, adapters, and Discourse communities.

DiscussionBridge Services provides paid implementation, migration,
customization, training, operations, and extensive support. DiscussionBridge
Community provides public documentation and community support, with the team
helping as capacity permits.

The free products must be genuinely capable. SaaS sells managed orchestration,
scale, governance, convenience, and operational relief—not freedom from
artificial limitations. All offerings share the portable DiscussionBridge
Core, contracts, policies, terminology, identity model, and trust boundaries.
They are deployment and service models within one product ecosystem, not
fragmented products.

The intact source decision is preserved in
`docs/evidence/DISCUSSION_BRIDGE_PRODUCT_FAMILY_DOCTRINE_2026-07-25.md`.

### Initial Classification Of Existing Astro Work

This classification is the starting architectural inventory. It identifies
ownership of behavior; it does not assert that code has already moved.

| Existing behavior | Architectural owner |
| --- | --- |
| source modes, single-writer/no-writeback rules, connections, target bindings, identity and direction | portable core |
| manifests, deterministic ordering, policy validation, comparisons, approvals, retry/idempotency, rollback, provenance, and audit records | portable core |
| content-lens, relationship, official-source, placeholder-suppression, and population eligibility policies | portable core |
| durable job execution, scheduling, operator approvals, inventory, and operational status UI | Discourse host/plugin |
| Discourse user/key authorization, permissions, categories, tags, topic state, and host-side diagnostics | Discourse host/plugin, through portable contracts where possible |
| Astro frontmatter projection, content collections/schema integration, route generation, and public navigation | Astro adapter |
| Astro/Starlight components, layouts, comments placement, source/official/related rendering, and progressive sidebar presentation | Astro adapter |
| Astro build hooks, package exports, demo fixtures, consumer installation, and deployment verification | Astro adapter and Astro delivery tooling |
| current CLI/API-only workflows | compatibility surface over portable behavior; retain while the Discourse host matures |

Before moving a specific module, review its dependencies and split mixed
responsibilities rather than moving an Astro-shaped abstraction wholesale into
the core.

## Public Alpha Distribution

The Astro package's public Alpha path is a GitHub prerelease with one exact
attached tarball built from the accepted commit. The release record fixes the
tag, commit, asset filename, byte size, SHA-256, and file inventory. Public
users verify that hash, install the same local asset with `--save-exact`, and
confirm the lockfile resolution/integrity matches the accepted record. Moving
branches and unversioned package names are not release identities.

npm registry publication is a later, separately authorized gate. It is not an
Alpha channel. A corrected Alpha receives a new prerelease tag and asset; never
replace or delete an existing release asset in place.

### Attribution And Licensing Release Contract

The automated attribution gate is now part of the package suite (73/73, Code
Boss final PASS). It checks objective license parity/holder, metadata,
production dependency licenses with explicit allowlist or reviewed override
evidence, required packed contents, README/non-affiliation and rendered links,
tracked-media provenance, and protected paths. Khroma 2.1.0 has durable reviewed
MIT evidence.

The docs build runs a bounded `--docs-scope` gate before rendering and reports
`PASS (docs scope)` while explicitly skipping npm package contents because they
require the built release candidate. Its 20/21 result is therefore not the full
73/73 package gate.

Both automated gates remain distinct from Manual Boss semantic judgment.
Release requires an exact `Attribution and Licensing: PASS / FAIL / N/A`,
reviewed paths, and a sanitized record tied to the release commit. That Manual
Boss result is now PASS for the corrected exact candidate through `b09dbce`
atop `7127eb1` and `462b3ae`, with no remaining findings. The
[sanitized review record](https://github.com/DiscussionBridge/astro-discussion-bridge/blob/main/docs/evidence/ATTRIBUTION_LICENSING_REVIEW_B09DBCE_2026-07-23.md)
records reviewed paths and the correction history. Later candidates require a
new semantic review.

## OBBBA Law As Amended Lens

`Law as Amended` remains a planned OBBBA content lens alongside `OBBBA Text`
and `Impact`. Its reader outcome and information architecture remain useful:
Astro should present reviewed official legal states, citations, provenance,
navigation, and accessible discussion connections.

The implementation boundary was reset on 2026-07-27. The inherited Bridge Boss
2 Law pipeline is abandoned as an implementation base. Its code, tests,
schemas, fixtures, parsers, caches, generated evidence, cardinalities, and
derivative source models are inert lessons-learned provenance. None is a
Product requirement or presumptively reusable input.

The replacement starts empty and official-source-first:

1. authoritative external official sources establish scope and legal state;
2. raw source identity, retrieval evidence, bytes, hashes, and neutral parsing
   support reviewed internal evidence;
3. Astro presents the reviewed material; and
4. optional Discourse context is joined only after official scope exists.

Discourse may contribute an optional verbatim title, organization
(tags/category/authored index), legislative drafting, topic identity, and
discussion binding. Forum bodies, OBBBA Text, local derivatives, diagnostics,
and the historical 309-item forum inventory never establish legal body,
official scope, or official cardinality.

Settled facts remain independent of the abandoned implementation:

- Section 20009 is enacted, present, and mandatory; omission is parser or
  artifact failure.
- Phil/Boss has settled that Section 70310 does not exist. Do not reopen a
  targeted search. A neutral exhaustive official-source inventory must not be
  distorted to preserve that conclusion; contradictory controlling evidence
  stops work as `BLOCKED - DOCTRINE/EVIDENCE CONFLICT`.
- Section 71119 is official-source-first. Optional forum identity cannot
  establish its enacted binding.
- The historical count of 309 describes forum identities/discussion bindings
  only and must not constrain official-source discovery.

The clean-room work is OBBBA-specific site/adapter evidence. It is not
DiscussionBridge Core or reusable Astro-package behavior. Publication,
Gate 2, legacy salvage, and portable adoption each require their own explicit
approval.

## Product Frame

DiscussionBridge shows a path from static publishing to living community infrastructure.

Publish from Astro. Discuss in Discourse. Keep the relationship alive.

Static sites are excellent at clarity, speed, ownership, and presentation. Discourse is excellent at memory, reply, trust, moderation, notification, and continuity. DiscussionBridge gives organizations a practical path between those worlds without forcing them to give up either one.

## Operating Principle

WebSynergetics finds the durable system by doing the useful work.

For DiscussionBridge, the durable product loop is:

publish -> sync -> diagnose -> maintain -> recover -> document

Every feature should make that loop more usable, understandable, and recoverable. The product is not only topic creation; it is the operating system around linked publishing and community discussion.

## Product Identity At The Comments Boundary

DiscussionBridge renders the restrained, linked credit `Connected by
DiscussionBridge` after the complete discussion surface. It is enabled by
default, works in `simple`, `full`, and `fullInteractive`, and can be disabled or
plain-text customized through `comments.credit` without changing comments or
Discourse settings.

The credit remains visually secondary, inherits host-site theme tokens, provides
equivalent hover and keyboard-focus treatment, respects reduced-motion
preferences, and is emitted by package configuration rather than hard-coded
site content. It is independent of Discourse's `Powered by Discourse` setting.

For `fullInteractive`, DiscussionBridge enables Discourse's content-aware iframe
height by default. The operator contract exposes the initial height, minimum,
maximum, and an explicit dynamic-height disable switch. Product defaults are
800px initial, 360px minimum, and 900px content maximum. Qualified Discourse
Core owns dynamic height updates; the adapter no longer layers a CSS viewport
ceiling over them because the Alpha.5 human pass proved that doing so can clip
topic-progress and composer content at the host boundary. The deprecated
`embedViewportMaxHeight` option accepts only `"none"` and otherwise fails
configuration.

## Bounded Cross-Forum Proof

Alpha includes implemented multi-target operation. Package commit `60e41e1`
establishes the code and test baseline; the OBBBA/Citizen Activist live topology
proof remains an open release gate:

- the same selected `onebigbeautifulbill.us` page connects to both
  `forum.repealobbba.org` and `forum.citizenactivist.network` through an explicit
  ordered target list;
- bounded demo/credit pages connect to `forum.discussionbridge.dev`;
- multiple Astro/public sites converge on `forum.repealobbba.org`;

The bounded OBBBA → Citizen Activist live proof completed at adoption commit
`36df91c98a35251edd6ddd657cca42ddf0acdafa`. The live 10101 page preserves
Repeal OBBBA topic 434 as protected source and primary `fullInteractive`
discussion, while accessible Additional discussions navigation links to Citizen
Activist topic 9. Target diagnostics, target-specific dry-run, publication,
unchanged retry, clean build, deployment, live binding checks, and no-writeback
checks passed.

After closure, Citizen Activist topic 9 accepted a live reply as public post 2.
The Astro page still embedded protected/primary Repeal OBBBA topic 434, and the
Citizen Activist thread remained independently reachable through accessible
Additional discussions navigation. This strengthens interaction/presentation
evidence only; it does not expand the bounded claim.

This proves the tested same-page two-forum topology, not a general
many-to-many administration plane. Credential records remain protected; their
format cleanup is a vault task, not public documentation. Dependency review is
still required for the exact install's 10 audit findings (1 low, 1 moderate,
8 high); do not run an automatic audit fix.

The CitizenActivist.Network forum is publicly described as “A community of
activists.”

For each non-default target, configure the named target, select the pages
explicitly, run diagnostics, verify build and live topic/page bindings, and prove
there is no cross-target writeback. Production OBBBA source lanes remain on
`forum.repealobbba.org`.

This is a real Alpha product capability, not topology wording alone. The model
must distinguish the source target from publication/discussion targets and
persist forum identity, topic ID/URL, sync state, error state, and display policy
for every target independently. An imported or Discourse-managed source retains
its no-writeback protection while the page may publish explicitly to another
target.

Comments presentation must declare one primary rendered discussion and how
additional targets are linked or rendered; the bridge must never silently pick
one. Multi-target writes use recoverable partial-success semantics: keep
successful bindings, report the failed target, and retry idempotently without
creating duplicate topics. Diagnostics, dry-run, CLI output, manuals, and live
proof are target-specific. General many-to-many administration remains later.

The settled frontmatter contract is:

- `discussionTargets`: ordered CSV of every named target for the page;
- `discussionPublishTargets`: explicit writable subset;
- `discussionSourceTarget`: protected imported/managed source target;
- `discussionTargetBindings`: JSON scalar map keyed by target, preserving each
  topic ID/URL, source hash, sync time, status, sanitized error, and attempt time;
- `discussionPrimaryTarget`: required when more than one linked discussion exists.

The CLI intentionally operates on one explicit `--target` per run. Build-time
publishing may use ordered `publishOnBuild.lanes`; each lane names its target and
may supply its own forum URL and direct or named-environment credentials. Lanes
run sequentially, so a later failure does not erase earlier success. Retry only
the failed target. A 422 embed/title collision is reconciled to the discovered
owning topic for that target. Malformed binding JSON or shape fails before any
network access.

At presentation time the declared primary discussion renders in the chosen
comments mode. Additional discussions appear as accessible named links, with
optional `targetLabels`. Multiple linked discussions without an explicit primary
fail clearly instead of choosing silently. Reusable parsing, presentation, label,
and type helpers are public through `astro-discussion-bridge/targets`.

The `forum.` hostname is deliberately literal and operationally clear; community
meaning belongs in the forum identity and copy. Cloudflare/account ownership
placement remains an Ops decision.

### Every connection has a job

DiscussionBridge does not pour every conversation into one shared comment
stream. It connects each page to the right community for a declared reason.
Every connection tells people who the conversation is for, what they can do
there, and where the durable source lives. Each community keeps its own members,
moderation, permissions, history, and context.

Target labels alone are insufficient. The Citizen Activist additional-target
reply felt odd because the interface named a destination without explaining why
that connection mattered. Reader-facing language should instead say things like:

- **Discuss with the Citizen Activist Community** — Public advocacy discussion.
  Replies remain in the CAN Community.
- **Review with the policy team** — Private internal review for staff and
  subject-matter experts.
- **Discuss with your state chapter** — Local implementation and impact
  discussion.
- **View the source wiki** — This guide is maintained by the community in
  Discourse.

Independent replies remain independent; the bridge must not silently merge
them. Primary versus additional presentation stays explicit. Relay, promotion,
or summary behavior is later scope and requires its own contract.

### Every Automated Actor Has An Origin

The preferred Astro-to-Discourse actor is now configured with `--post-as`,
`DISCOURSE_POST_AS`, or lane/default `postAs`/`postAsEnv`; legacy API-username
controls remain fallback-compatible. The resolved actor is sent as
`Api-Username`. Discourse key User Level controls whether a key is bound to one
user or may act for a supplied username, while key Scope independently controls
endpoints.

`postAs` does not silently transfer ownership of an existing topic. Owner
transfer remains a separate future operation. Imported source-author metadata
now follows the current Discourse first-post author during explicit overwrite
refresh and renders only through a safe same-forum profile link. Profile URL
construction preserves a Discourse subfolder base, so a topic under
`https://example.com/forum/t/...` links to
`https://example.com/forum/u/editorbridgeforum`. Regression coverage includes
that base preservation plus real `--post-as` CLI execution and dry-run actor
output; those regressions remain covered in the current 79/79 package suite.

Source category is now durable WHEREFROM metadata. Import records
`discussionSourceCategoryId`; skip, dry-run overwrite, and live overwrite
compare the current Discourse category with the existing opening YAML
frontmatter. A change is reported as `source category changed: OLD -> NEW;
Astro route/navigation unchanged`. Overwrite refreshes that source fact but
does not move the destination file, public route, or Astro navigation lane.
Those WHERETO decisions remain explicit and reviewable. Direct and strict
atomic-manifest paths preserve the reason and all source/no-writeback
protections. Opening-frontmatter parsing is LF/CRLF/BOM safe and ignores
body/code-block lookalikes. Code Boss passed the reviewed implementation; the
current package suite passes 79/79.

Many-to-many operation must not create identical or visually ambiguous
nonhuman identities across forums. Service identities encode role plus origin:
candidate forum-source editors are `editorbridgeforum` / **DiscussionBridge
Forum Editor** and `editorcanforum` / **CAN Forum Editor**, subject to each
forum's normalized username rules and availability. Astro-origin actors name
their source site/brand; established `obbba-bot` remains the OBBBA source
identity.

Each forum should use a `special-admin` custom group as the visible inventory
for nonhuman admin/service accounts. That group is not an authorization
mechanism and grants no admin status, category permissions, or API rights.

Category intent is source- and target-specific. A configured category is
authoritative for Astro-managed topics and sync corrects drift. Without a
configured category, manual Discourse placement remains. Discourse-managed and
imported source topics are protected from category writeback, while each
publication target keeps an independent category contract.

Citizen Activist Network supports both directions through separate page/topic
pairs with explicit ownership. Astro-managed `citizenactivist.network` content
may publish companion topics to `forum.citizenactivist.network`; selected forum
topics may become Discourse-managed or imported Astro pages. Never make the same
item writable in both directions at once. That single-writer rule prevents
publication loops.

The public promise is: **Publish from the site. Learn in the community. Turn
what the community knows into durable pages.** One site and one community can
work in both directions: an Astro apex blog post can start discussion on the CAN
forum, while a protected community-authored Discourse source topic or how-to
can become a durable page on the apex site without losing its forum source or
history. Wiki status is optional.

Candidate implementation vocabulary—pending design review, not final or
implemented—is `role`/`purpose`, `audience`, `callToAction`, `description`, a
visibility/context note, direction/source ownership, and presentation as
embedded primary versus linked additional. Candidate roles include
`primary-community`, `public-community`, `chapter`, `internal-review`,
`expert-feedback`, `source-wiki`, and `syndication`.

### Local ownership. National reach.

A governed chapter-to-national connection is a strong future use case. A local
chapter can promote selected work from a designated category on its own forum
into a mapped national category, remaining visibly credited and linked to the
place where the work began. Local coordination replies and national learning/
amplification replies remain separate because they have different jobs.

The reverse direction is also useful: national campaign guidance can distribute
to selected chapter forums for local discussion and adaptation. This is a
governed hub-and-spoke/federated pattern, not silent post duplication. Public
language can say **Discuss with the local chapter**, **Join the national
discussion**, **See how other chapters are responding**, or **Share this chapter
report with the national community**.

Future design must carry source forum/topic and chapter identity, parent/child
relationship, mapped categories, required region/chapter tags, automatic versus
moderator-approved promotion, public/private eligibility, attribution/return
link, target-specific title/CTA/description, one-way first-post sync,
independent replies, target-specific recovery/idempotency, and moderation
ownership at both levels. Optional posting as chapter identity is later scope.
Current DiscussionBridge does not claim full forum-to-forum orchestration.
These governance mappings and approvals belong in future optional plugin/control-
plane design; they must not become a Tier 1 plugin dependency.

## CDN-Backed Discourse Field Proof

`forum.repealobbba.org` is served through Cloudflare CDN. The completed OBBBA
work therefore proves DiscussionBridge compatibility with this production
CDN-backed Discourse deployment across the workflows actually tested:
diagnostics/API reads, imports, topic reconciliation and protected source links,
`fullInteractive` comments and signed-in replies, source disclosure, and
no-writeback behavior.

The claim is deliberately bounded. It does not guarantee every Cloudflare,
CDN, WAF, or cache-rule combination. Operators must preserve Discourse API/JSON
paths, embed/full-app routes, authentication and cookies, and websocket behavior.
When edge behavior differs from direct origin, investigate cache/WAF treatment.
The bounded Citizen Activist multi-target live gate is complete; wider matrix
edges and general administration remain separate scope.

## Discourse Source Disclosure

Source provenance is implemented and reviewed at `a9d2097` (Code Boss PASS,
68/68). `DiscussionSource.astro` gives imported and Discourse-managed pages a
quiet, accessible source notice near the article start. It is deliberately
separate from comments and the proposed DiscussionBridge credit.

The helper resolves only `discourse-imported` and `discourse-managed`; Astro-
managed and unknown modes produce no notice. It prefers an explicit URL, then
the imported-from URL, then the protected source-target binding, and finally
legacy topic metadata. Unsafe URLs are skipped without suppressing the notice.
On multi-target pages provenance follows the protected source—not an additional
publication forum.

The package exports the component plus `resolveDiscussionSourceNotice`,
`DiscussionSourceMode`, and `DiscussionSourceNotice` through the root and
`./source`. Canonical Astro and Starlight boundaries are wired.

OBBBA adoption is complete at `aa7846d` using reviewed artifact
`astro-discussion-bridge-0.1.0-alpha-a9d2097-f3fbb73e.tgz` (SHA256
`F3FBB73E95D52B5799FBEBE5221298040FD32292EDA8BD76C257C0C19E4267B2`). A clean
detached install/build passed, deployment succeeded, and all five canonical
Title I routes showed exactly one correctly labeled source aside/link to their
protected Repeal OBBBA topics while preserving the discussion boundary. No
Discourse write occurred. The later Citizen Activist publication preserved this
protected source and did not write back to it.

## Alpha Import Queue Principle

Alpha includes deterministic import discovery, not only one-off topic import.
Curated manifests preserve the caller's chosen order. Category queue work first
discovers categories and subcategories, then selects one by ID or unambiguous
slug/name. After preview, “next” defaults to oldest Discourse `created_at`, with
topic ID as the stable tie-breaker. Tags, created-date range, open/closed status,
and limit remain optional filters.

Community activity is not publishing priority. `bumped_at`, last reply, and
latest activity must never reorder an import queue. Operators preview candidates
first, and already imported topics stay out of the selectable queue.

For numbered legislative or structured collections, natural topic-title/name
ordering is also an Alpha option when creation dates are muddled. This is still
editorial ordering, never latest-activity ordering.

The read-only `discover-imports` implementation now turns that principle into
an operator workflow. It lists and selects categories by exact ID, slug, or
name; optionally includes descendants; filters by tags, created range,
open/closed state, and limit; and orders oldest/newest by `created_at` with a
topic-ID tie-break or by natural title. It recursively excludes local source
and target-binding topic IDs, previews candidates, supports JSON, and may write
a new—but never overwrite an existing—strict v1 manifest. Public-category
discovery requires no site URL or credentials.

Final review tightened the safety boundary: runtime source-mode/comments-display
values reject before network or local scans; the writer validates before
dereference/filesystem work; exclusions use only opening-frontmatter
`discourseTopicId` and strictly parsed target bindings; unrelated `topicId`
metadata stays eligible. Descendants are fetched directly and deduplicated,
and date-only `created-to` includes the full UTC day.

Code Boss returned PASS after three correction rounds, the package suite passes
84/84, and the full attribution/package gate passes. A live read-only CDN-backed
TITLE-I/category-18 run scanned 320 topics, excluded five already imported
topics, and returned the next ten natural-title candidates beginning with topic
754 (Section 10106); it wrote no files. Implementation, live read-only proof,
and Code Boss review are complete.

The next OBBBA Title I batch also proved a key-model boundary. Topic 754 was
readable at `/t/754.json`, but its first post lacked raw Markdown. Fetching that
first post by post ID at `/posts/761.json` returned 403 with the granular key;
`761` in that endpoint is the post ID, not the separate topic 761 in the batch.
The diagnostics/global key could read the required raw endpoint. Until
Discourse exposes or identifies a suitable
granular raw-post scope, controlled `import-existing` source reads may use the
protected diagnostics key in memory. It remains prohibited from CI/build,
runtime publishing, and deployment configuration.

The exact ten-topic manifest then completed live import, clean build, corrected
deployment, and per-route verification. Ten Astro files were created with zero
Discourse writes; all ten canonical routes are live with their expected source,
hero, disclosure, and discussion boundary. This is bounded OBBBA field
evidence, not a claim that every Discourse permission model or CDN/WAF policy
behaves identically.

## Accessible Hero Imports

Alpha supports an optional leading hero during `import-existing`, but image and
meaningful alt text are inseparable inputs. The bridge preserves the normalized
Discourse body after inserting the leading image and supports local paths, URLs,
spaces, and escaped alt text. This keeps accessibility part of the import
contract rather than a cleanup step.

## Fail-Closed Import Pruning

Pruning is an explicit import policy, not a loose text cleanup. The first Alpha
profile removes a known trailing community call-to-action only when its complete
boundary and marker set are verified. Ambiguity fails before writing, and the
selected profile is preserved in import metadata.

Because hero, pruning, and comments policy may differ by topic, deterministic
multi-page refresh uses the reviewed ordered import manifest. It preserves
caller order and each topic's policy, rejects ambiguous inputs, preflights and
stages the complete batch, then uses atomic creation or overwrite rollback. A
blanket “update all” cannot safely reconstruct heterogeneous page policy.

The OBBBA five-page live proof (`434`, `747`, `751`, `752`, `753`) confirmed one
correctly bound discussion per route and the expected hero/prune policies. It
also established a release lesson: production-shaped verification must include
a clean build of the exact tracked commit. A dirty local deletion had hidden a
stale tracked starter page, so the removal was isolated before deployment while
unrelated changes and superseded artifacts remained untouched.

Curated import routing now has an explicit WHEREFROM/WHERETO product model.
WHEREFROM proves the Discourse source identity, curated order, category where
applicable, and required tags/filters before writing. WHERETO fixes the Astro
content root, safe output file, public route, site identity, and Astro navigation
lane. Manifest
v1 expresses this with its current flat fields (`topic` and `requiredTags`;
`docsDir`, `output`, site/route settings, and the site title-lane map). A nested
`from`/`to` schema may be explored later, but is not a v1 redesign.

The OBBBA Title-lane proof requires `TITLE-I` on all five source topics, routes
each entry explicitly, generates Starlight Title I–X navigation from the site
map, and passed clean build plus live verification on Worker version
`cde279d5-1c27-452c-964f-59d8dfd7c320`.

## Comments Rendering Ownership

For active Alpha consideration on CAN, use the existing Discourse Mermaid theme
component as the immediate baseline for normal topics, and start a bounded
optional `DiscussionBridge for Discourse` slice for Mermaid inside full-app
embeds, table presentation parity, embed-context detection, and tests. This is a
proposal pending design/review; it is not completed. Tier 1 remains API-only and
must not require the plugin.

The live OBBBA outer Astro page renders its Mermaid SVG and five HTML tables.
The cooked Discourse HTML for topic `434` still contains `code.lang-mermaid`
and a table. In `fullInteractive`, that content lives in a cross-origin iframe
owned by Discourse; host Astro transforms and CSS cannot cross that boundary to
render Mermaid or restyle the tables.

The package's bridge-rendered `full` mode has now completed that parity review.
It lazily renders Mermaid 11 with strict security and source-preserving failure
fallback, styles tables for readability and overflow, and exposes
`replies.renderMermaid` as a default-true public option. The lazy chunk may cause
Vite's greater-than-500-kB build warning, but is fetched only when needed.

`fullInteractive` remains a different product boundary. The ordinary topic-434
view renders Mermaid through the Discourse theme component, but the full-app
comments embed leaves Mermaid as raw code because normal theme-component JS is
not loaded there. Tables parse but need stronger embedded styling. The immediate
supported table path is Discourse `common/embedded.scss`, targeted with the new
embed class hook. Mermaid remains open pending a Discourse embed extension,
plugin, or upstream answer; it is not fixed by the `full` implementation.

The official Discourse Mermaid offering is specifically the official
**Discourse Mermaid theme component**, not a plugin. Keep four paths distinct:
use the existing theme component, fork/extend that theme component, build the
separate optional `DiscussionBridge for Discourse` plugin, or pursue an
upstream Discourse change. Never call the official theme component the
“DiscussionBridge Mermaid plugin.” Tier 1 remains API-only and independent.

Commit `d7800d7` passed Code Boss review and 51/51 package tests plus plain Astro
and Starlight production builds. This implementation pass made no OBBBA content
writes and performed no live deployment.

## Alpha And Beta Product Doctrine

### Alpha Feature Lock

The cumulative Alpha feature/function set in the build/launch checklist is now
locked. New work after the lock must close a recorded promise or release gate,
fix behavior tested by implementation or users, or be approved explicitly as
a scope change. Remaining unchecked work is the proof, operations,
documentation, compatibility, and release work required to finish the locked
promise.

Alpha should be nearly feature-complete for the product promise it declares.
Major capabilities already known to be central belong in Alpha scope or must be
removed from that promise; planned deferral of known product pillars is not the
default Beta strategy. This does not pull every long-term, plugin, or Layer 3
idea into Alpha.

Beta primarily refines what real users test: usability, compatibility,
reliability, performance, packaging, documentation, installation, recovery,
support, and presentation. User evidence may still reveal a genuinely missing
capability during Beta, but Beta is not the planned home for central pillars we
already understand.

Tier 1 remains the free/self-serve, API-only floor and must remain useful without
installing a Discourse plugin. `DiscussionBridge for Discourse` is accepted
Alpha product work and the natural forum-governed control plane. The current
local v0.1 implementation provides authenticated create-or-resolve, a
non-`system` operating identity, forum-authoritative category/tag policy,
durable reservation and source mapping, forced-unlisted controlled topic
creation, audit, and a fail-closed no-Core-fallback posture. It is verified
against stock local Discourse but is not installed or deployed.
The default-disabled comments-only `fullInteractive` slice is now implemented
locally for completed mappings through Discourse Core's full-app redirect. It
removes companion post 1 from embed layout only and leaves normal topics
unchanged. Unit/request verification passes; browser verification passes for
empty, replied/actions, and ordinary long-topic presentation. Live-install
acceptance remains open. Local development-server acceptance also passes safe
endpoint-disabled startup, full client boot, and operator-disable rollback.

Listing connected topics is forum-owned governance when the publishing-site
operator and forum operator differ. The interim Core Alpha posture is unlisted
by default as a discovery delay and forum-review convention. The forum operator
may manually list a reviewed topic, but Core does not guarantee that approval
boundary because a first reply may list it automatically. Astro pages and lanes
may request a listed or unlisted disposition, but a request is not authority
and must not override forum policy. DiscussionBridge must preserve requested
and actual visibility as distinct states.

Discourse Core's global unlisted-until-reply behavior does not provide manual
approval because a first reply may list the topic. The plugin therefore needs
an early server-enforced listing-governance slice: hold new connected topics
unlisted, present listing requests to a forum-operator review queue, record
approval/rejection/defer decisions and audit identity, and allow automatic
listing only through an explicit forum-owned trust policy scoped to the
connection, API user, category, tag, or lane. Broad API-key capability must not
be treated as permission to bypass that policy.

Guaranteed manual approval requires that plugin enforcement or a separately
restricted category whose permissions prevent public replies before approval.

That slice does not include the full control plane, post-as-user, PM automation,
or general many-to-many administration. The roadmap must not imply that Tier 1
requires plugin installation.

Alpha scope is cumulative. The plugin and same-page multi-target gates add to,
and do not replace, any previously accepted Alpha gate. The existing dashboard
and build/launch checklists are the source of truth for the complete scope;
items remain active unless Phil explicitly removes them.

All three Alpha software tracks remain free/open source unless a later explicit
decision changes that: `astro-discussion-bridge`, `DiscussionBridge for
Discourse`, and public docs/community support.
Paid value is implementation help, handholding, managed hosting and operations,
customization, support, and consulting. Operators remain responsible for
third-party infrastructure costs.

### DiscussionBridge.dev Dogfood Loop

Alpha must prove both directions as separate, single-writer connections:

1. An Astro-managed `discussionbridge.dev` blog post publishes a public
   companion discussion to `forum.discussionbridge.dev`.
2. A community wiki/how-to on `forum.discussionbridge.dev` is republished as a
   durable public guide on `discussionbridge.dev`.

The wiki lane is `discourse-managed`, uses `discussionSync: false`, discloses
its source, refreshes deterministically, and has an explicit public route and
Astro navigation lane. Its source forum topic remains the primary discussion.
Edits originate in the wiki topic; the site republishes reviewed source.
Comments presentation is explicit, and independent reply streams are never
described or presented as merged.

The reader-facing outcome is: “The site starts conversations. The community
develops durable knowledge. The site publishes what the community learns.”

Package commit `1731547` closes the explicit import-mode implementation gap.
Code Boss passed the change with 72/72 tests. `import-existing` now selects
`discourse-imported` or `discourse-managed`, defaults to imported, rejects
`astro-managed`, always retains `discussionSync: false`, and supports per-entry
manifest `sourceMode`. A public dry run of forum topic `36` passed for the
planned guide route
`/guides/how-to-choose-a-discussion-bridge-source-mode/`.

The reviewed artifact is
`astro-discussion-bridge-0.1.0-alpha-1731547-7d8951d1.tgz` with SHA256
`7d8951d15f4b0a4a4f14e238665bc41c28255c6f2cdcb1979105926ba6f4affb`.
The apex guide schema now retains import metadata while allowing imported
guides without hand-authored `description`/`pubDate`, and the Astro 7 engine
contract is Node `>=22.12.0`.

Apex commit `d68ffc4` completed the bounded two-direction dogfood proof with
Code Boss PASS, a clean detached install/build producing five actual public
apex routes, push, and live Cloudflare deployment on 2026-07-23. That apex
route count is separate from the Product Boss readable-docs render of 20
synchronized documentation sources and 21 generated HTML pages. The
Astro-managed blog route binds
independent public topic `37`. The Discourse-managed guide discloses and renders
wiki topic `36` as its primary fullInteractive discussion. A deliberate guide
sync dry run skipped for no-writeback, and the raw Pages hostname redirects to
the canonical apex.

The claim is limited to these two separate single-writer connections; it does
not merge reply streams or prove general forum-to-forum orchestration. One high
npm audit finding and the Mermaid >500 kB chunk warning remain recorded; no
automatic audit fix was run.
[Sanitized verification evidence](https://github.com/DiscussionBridge/astro-discussion-bridge/blob/main/docs/evidence/DISCUSSIONBRIDGE_DEV_TWO_WAY_DOGFOOD_2026-07-23.md)
preserves the live facts that are not contained in the apex source commit.

### OBBBA Navigation And Taxonomy Contract

The OBBBA information architecture separates bill structure from content lens:

- **Bill Structure** contains the content lenses **OBBBA Text** first,
  **Impact** second, and **Law as Amended** later when suitable.
- Each lane names its own controlling structure authority.
- Authoritative external official sources define scope, hierarchy, order,
  labels, and local routes for official-source lanes.
- Discourse categories, tag groups, index topics, and topic tags may define
  structure only for a forum-authored lane.
- Optional forum metadata and discussion bindings join only after official
  scope exists.

Local hierarchy/group nodes do not require Discourse topics. Never create a
synthetic topic to satisfy navigation. A node claiming a forum connection must
provide its complete topic ID and source URL together; partial connections
fail closed. Preserve optional source tags as provenance and never let them
override official hierarchy or become automatic public workflow navigation.

The UX principle is **complete structure, progressive presentation**. Every
published item remains reachable through navigation, while the ordinary page
view shows the content lenses and Titles globally and expands only the current
lens, current Title, and active Subtitle/Chapter/Subchapter/Part branch. Other
branches remain collapsed but user-expandable, with expansion preserved where
appropriate. Index pages provide the complete outline/browse surface.
Breadcrumbs, authored previous/next links, and search provide additional ways
through the structure.

Do not visibly render—or preferably unnecessarily place in the DOM—hundreds of
Title VII section links on every route. On tablet and mobile, the navigation
drawer should open the active branch and remain keyboard- and screen-reader
usable. Verification must cover desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile, with
specific scale testing against Title VII.

The reusable product contract is an adapter-neutral navigation manifest whose
authority is explicit per lane. Starlight and plain Astro decide presentation.
Forum discovery remains available for forum-authored lanes, but it is not a
prerequisite for local or official-source navigation.

Package implementation is complete at `e775af3`, with bounded public-field
429 handling corrected at `bc8acb5` and legal case-comparison safety corrected
at `db1c57a`. Code Boss final PASS and 107/107 tests plus `npm run check`
passed. `discover-navigation` builds the strict adapter-neutral
navigation manifest read-only from category, exact tag-group, and index-topic
authority. `DiscussionNavigation` provides progressive presentation, and the
Starlight sidebar adapter plus plain Astro demo consume the result. Authored
links must be same-origin/base-path safe; local routes bind only when the source
topic matches. The create-only manifest supports anonymous or authenticated
discovery and preserves source-tag provenance.

The current exact OBBBA Text candidate starts from GovInfo Public Law 119-21
and renders all 310 official sections locally. It joins 307 complete optional
forum bindings afterward. Sections 1, 20009, and 71119 have no forum binding
and require none; Section 70310 is absent. The candidate sitemap contains 331
unique routes, every official navigation destination is present, and the
preserved Impact lens retains 15 local routes. The historical 309 forum count
is not used as enacted-law cardinality.

The frozen rendered candidate passed Code, Product, and Manual reader review;
publication and deployment remain separately unauthorized. Law as
Amended remains outside current Astro adoption.

### Official-Source Enrichment And Cross-Lens Relations

The reusable enrichment model distinguishes two source roles on a
Discourse-managed public-record page. Official-text authority belongs to the
authoritative public record:

- **Content source:** the protected Discourse source topic. It may be a wiki,
  but wiki status is optional metadata rather than the ownership or safety
  basis.
- **Official text:** the authoritative public record, identified by document,
  structural locator, citation/page range, and official links.

For OBBBA, the authoritative record is Congress.gov Public Law 119-21. Use the
Congress.gov text page as the durable overview, USLM XML for machine-readable
hierarchy and text, official TXT for page-marker/fallback evidence, and PDF for
authoritative visual verification. Cite Statutes at Large pages rather than
ambiguous PDF file-page numbers.

Proposed metadata includes document/law identity, section ID and label,
official citation and URLs, check time, source hash, and comparison result.
Outcomes are `exact`, `presentation-only`, `substantive-difference`, and
`unresolved`. Missing, duplicate, or ambiguous section matching must fail
closed or require review. Comparison must never silently rewrite community
text.

Presentation-only normalization may remove Markdown link syntax, whitespace
and line-wrap differences, typographic punctuation, official page furniture,
and official side notes, but it must preserve substantive wording and
numbering. The comparator preserves case. Capitalization-only differences are
`substantive-difference` and use the review/explicit-override path because legal
capitalization can identify defined terms or identifiers.

The first bounded field proof compared forum topic 34/post 40, Section 10101,
with USLM identifier `/us/pl/119/21/tI/stA/s10101`. After bounded
normalization, both sources contained 608 tokens and 3,148 normalized
characters with zero substantive differences. The official citation is Public
Law 119-21, Section 10101, 139 Stat. 80–81. This represents that section only;
it does not establish that all OBBBA topics match.

Public pages should independently link **Content source** to the protected
Discourse source topic and **Official text** to the identified law/section and
citation. Wiki status, when present, is optional metadata. Keep this
provenance/authority layer separate from related-content navigation.

A stable shared key such as `sectionId` should generate reciprocal Related
links across **OBBBA Text**, **Law as Amended**, **Impact**, and future
**Stories**. The aggregate graph is many-to-many: one section can list many
Stories, and one Story can reference many sections.

Impact relationship eligibility is broader than Astro publication eligibility.
Many Impact source topics began with the same invitation-only placeholder; some
now contain developed analysis and some still contain only that placeholder.
Placeholder-only topics must not become public Astro Impact pages. They remain
valid protected Discourse relationship targets, so the corresponding OBBBA Text
page may link to the forum topic. A developed and reviewed Impact topic may
instead publish to Astro and become the reciprocal Astro relationship target.
Freeze the canonical Section 82001/topic 1002 placeholder as a dated snapshot
with post identity, normalization version, and normalized-content SHA-256;
later edits to topic 1002 must not silently move the baseline. The population
dry run must classify each first post as placeholder-suppressed,
publication-candidate, or review-required. A nonmatching hash is not proof of
developed content: minor edits, partial removal, mixed placeholder/content, and
normalization uncertainty require review. Publication candidates still pass
the normal review gate. If a published source later drifts toward the
placeholder, report it for operator review without automatically deleting or
replacing its Astro page. Placeholder links must be labeled as forum
discussion, not published Impact analysis.

Regenerating the adapter-neutral relationship/taxonomy manifest plus rebuilding
Astro should update reciprocal links without body reimport or manual per-page
edits. A reader-facing pattern is:
`Related: Read the enacted text · Explore the impact · View 3 community stories`.

The public-accountability chain is official record → structured section →
legal/practical analysis → human consequences → community scrutiny/correction.
The components are Official text, Law as Amended, Impact, Stories, Community,
Provenance, Source comparison, and Navigation. This model generalizes to
Congress, state legislatures, municipal ordinances, regulations, budgets,
ballot measures, and agency rulemaking.

This is strategy discovered through implementation. Commit `e775af3`
implements strict `us-public-law` enrichment, fail-closed manifest-v2
preflight, source-tag provenance, stable `sectionId` many-to-many Stories,
accessible `DiscussionRelations`, and virtual
rebuild-time relationship generation. Official URLs are restricted to HTTPS
Congress.gov hosts, including final redirects; USLM XML is primary, official
TXT is fallback, and PDF is optional visual evidence. Only an explicit
per-entry override permits a substantive comparison result.

No-overwrite imports skip before raw-post or official-source reads. OBBBA topic
34 is now locally imported as `discourse-managed` with `discussionSync: false`,
source author/category/tags preserved, official comparison
`presentation-only`, and citation 139 Stat. 80–81. All 15 Impact pages carry
`contentLens: impact` and stable `sectionId`; reciprocal Section 10101 links
render in both directions.

The replacement OBBBA Text candidate starts from GovInfo PLAW-119publ21 USLM,
which defines 310 enacted sections and their hierarchy, labels, order, routes,
and bodies. DiscussionBridge joins 307 optional complete forum bindings only
after that scope exists. Sections 1, 20009, and 71119 remain local official
pages without forum bindings; Section 70310 is absent, and the 309 forum count
is not legal cardinality. The build preserves all 15 Impact routes and contains
331 unique sitemap routes. Publication and deployment remain unauthorized.

Post-deploy read-only GETs confirmed both independent Discourse identities:
source topic 34 remains category 5 with first poster `editor`, one post,
`last_posted_at` `2025-07-14T17:03:43.795Z`; Impact topic 434 remains category
18 with first poster `editor`, 12 posts, `last_posted_at`
`2026-07-22T05:14:56.195Z` and `wiki=true`. Topic 34 currently reports
`wiki=false`; do not
describe this specific topic as a wiki. It remains the protected
`discourse-managed` source under the Bridge source-mode contract. These GETs
produced no post or write.

Broader scale/accessibility proof and the reported dependency vulnerabilities
remain open.

Public Discourse 429 handling uses sequential tag-group reads, retries only
429, allows at most three retries, honors bounded `Retry-After` seconds/date or
fallback delay, and cancels rejected bodies with a 50 ms bound. It never
retries 403.

The reviewed navigation package artifact is
`astro-discussion-bridge-0.1.0-alpha-official-nav-19f3066a.tgz`, SHA256
`19f3066a1affc8d835d321aa1fb91af663800d5baa57d7a9e9a811d9b43655a9`,
with 88,722 bytes and package tests 113/113 PASS.

### Verified Documentation Update Metadata

Docs-site commit `02206f7` implements verified page-update metadata. Each
readable page shows **Last updated** and
**Applies to: DiscussionBridge Alpha** directly below its title. The footer
repeats only Last updated and links to the exact canonical source on GitHub.
Desktop 1440 and mobile 390 visual/DOM checks passed.

Last updated means the canonical documentation source changed; it is not a
build or deployment timestamp. The tracked
`docs/DOCS_PAGE_METADATA.json` ledger stores one date and SHA-256 for every
synchronized source. Normal builds do not consult Git history. They fail closed
when a source is missing, membership is stale, or a byte-level hash differs.

After intentionally editing canonical files under `docs/`, run
`npm run refresh-metadata` from `sites/docs`. The explicit refresh preserves
unchanged dates, updates changed pages, initializes new entries, and rebuilds
exact source membership. Prebuild runs metadata tests before synchronization
and the bounded attribution check.

This verifies update metadata and source correspondence. It does not replace
semantic review, attribution/licensing review, or release approval.

### After Alpha

Beta primarily refines tested usability, compatibility, reliability,
performance, packaging, installation, recovery, support, documentation, and
presentation. The plugin v0.1 Alpha slice remains intentionally bounded, but
the settled product architecture now places the portable core and natural
control plane in the Discourse-hosted product. Expanding that host must proceed
through reviewed vertical slices rather than pulling every later control-plane
idea into v0.1. Post-as-user, PM automation, and broad unattended
forum-to-forum administration remain outside v0.1 unless separately approved.
Tier 1 remains useful without the plugin as a compatibility path.

The current logical/workspace home for that optional plugin is
`DiscussionBridge/plugins/discourse-discussion-bridge`. The `plugins` directory
may move higher later. Physical GitHub repository naming and placement remain a
Boss/folder decision because GitHub organizations do not provide nested
repositories.

### Boss-Lane Handoff Retrospective

Replacing a saturated Boss task requires more than transferring repository
state, commits, files, and open gates. The successor must receive the lived
operating doctrine that explains how the product reached that state:

- non-negotiable product invariants;
- settled decisions and the evidence behind them;
- known operator workflows that already work;
- exceptional recovery procedures that must not become normal operations;
- user expectations about acceptable complexity; and
- lane ownership and escalation boundaries.

The Bridge Boss replacement handoff did not transfer enough of that context.
The successor over-optimized for generic credential security, centered a new
transport architecture, and treated an exposed-key incident as grounds for a
new normal operating model. That drift would likely not have occurred in the
context-rich predecessor lane.

The settled invariant is that every Bridge operation uses a user-created
Discourse API key. Bridge tooling may safely store, reference, validate, scope,
audit, rotate, and use that key, but it does not replace the credential model.
Phil's established vault/Context/Notepad workflow is known operating context,
not an unknown to be redesigned away. Exposed-key revocation and history
cleanup are exceptional remediation, not routine task ceremony.

Standing handoff rule: a successor Boss package must explicitly transfer facts,
product intent, operating doctrine, settled workflows, invariants, exceptions,
and the reasons behind prior decisions. If any of those are missing, the
successor pauses architecture changes and reconstructs them from the durable
docs and predecessor record before acting.

#### Successor Readiness Checkpoint

After any Boss-lane handoff, product, design, and operator work remains paused
until the successor restates the following checkpoint and Phil accepts it:

1. Non-negotiable product invariants.
2. Known working human and machine workflows.
3. Exceptional incidents and recovery actions that must not become doctrine.
4. Current blocked and unblocked state, with evidence.
5. The exact next action.
6. Explicitly out-of-scope alternatives and expansions.

For DiscussionBridge, the checkpoint must always state:

- every Bridge operation is authorized by a user-created Discourse API key;
- durable identities are operating records around those keys, never alternate
  authority;
- routine operations reuse appropriately scoped keys rather than creating and
  revoking keys per run;
- exposed-key revocation and history cleanup are exceptional remediation; and
- no command or design move follows the handoff until Phil accepts the
  checkpoint.
